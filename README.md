# clustering-file-reader

# Introduction
clustering-file-reader is a library for parsing the clustering output produced by either [spectra-cluster](https://github.com/spectra-cluster/spectra-cluster) or [spectra-cluster-hadoop](https://github.com/spectra-cluster/spectra-cluster-hadoop) library.
The clustering result file is compact text file format which contains all the information related to clusters, these can include the consensus spectrum, precursor details, and spectrum related details.
This library supports parsing both the entire file and iterate over all the entries in a particular file
